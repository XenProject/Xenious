                                    	The Xbox Executable Editor
					By [ Hect0r ] / hect0r.com

					Contact : sysop@xenious.net

					   [ Basic Overview ]

		The project ahead is to create a fully working editor for the XBox executable ecosystem, 
			That includes a pe editor, right now the tool lacks some research.

				           [ * PLEASE NOTE * ]

		This tool will decrypt and decompress the embedded PE/DLL and read it.
			we no dont need xextool, thanks xenia and system.cryptography :)

				       [ What can you do to help ]

		If you get this error : 
	     "This executable has option header data that is currently unsupported by this editor..."
					          OR
    				"It appears this executable is different..."
		Then please compress the file with winrar and email it to me, So I can investigate 
			it as you might have found a new header I dont know of.

			            Any SDK > 21256.3, I wont leak :)

		Please consider donating some spare crypto to cover development costs.
		
		For source code, read DEBUG..., it is easy to build and debug :)
