So how to build and debug,

Download this repoistory as a zip or if you have the github app then clone it or git on cli just clone it, if you dont know how to use git then learn :)
Open "Xenious.sln" in Microsoft Visual Studio C# 2022 (Any Editon, I used Community Edition) or other.

You will need .NET Framwork 4.8 : https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer

Then Set to debug, it will show the current break points that hvave been left through debugging, the current build is x64 only, you can work on a 32bit one if you know how to and edit the code.

I have only built a editor which will be in Xenious.Forms.X360, the plan is to add more eco system types,..
in future the editor will support x86 and amd64 including the xenon powerpc. 

The editor is will be able to parse and compile powerpc at somepoint, debugging is needed and 
I have the kit but a lack of time so if people could submit solutions to problems they find and help me find dodgy code...
that would be great, more work needs to be done on things like mixups (addi should be li etc).

If you cannot debug, learn how to... its visual studio, the left hand side bar is where you place break points, you hover over the script to see info thats fucked and needs fixing...
